# ðŸ”Ž Profiling

It's tempting to just dive into your code and start refactoring at once! But you might end up spending lots of time eeking out tiny performance gains on parts of your code that are already pretty efficient - and completely missing the real bottlenecks.

That's why we start with profiling. Figure out where the problems are - and just how bad they really are. That way, you can make an evidence-based request for more time from management to spend on improving the code. 

Here are resources you might want to profile in terms of usage:
- CPU
- Memory
- Network bandwidth
- Disk IO

One other thing to always remember is that profiling can add to the computer workload, and slow things down. But hopefully this is only by a very tiny amount. 

In this chapter, we'll explore a variety of profiling methods. There's no universal panacea - it depends on how much time you have and how much granularity you need!
