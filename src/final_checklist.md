# âœ… Final Checklist

In summary, optimization in Python often revolves around improving time complexity, reducing memory usage, and leveraging Python's built-in features or external libraries that are implemented in C for speed. In the next section, we'll cover a brief checklist. If you only remember these things, you'll probably make good steps towards more performant code.

Like any other language, Python also has its own set of performance pitfalls, often referred to as "anti-patterns". These anti-patterns can significantly degrade the performance of a Python application if not addressed. So we'll finish with an overview of some common performance anti-patterns in Python and suggestions on how to avoid them!
