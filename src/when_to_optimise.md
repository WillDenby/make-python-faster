# ❓ When to Optimise your Code

In most organisations, programmers live under the following paradigm:

> Overall Team Velocity > Individual Code Optimisation

Some things in this book are quick wins/best practice. Other things require more of a time investment. Before considering any implementation of the latter, ask yourself the following questions:

1. **Does the code work?**
2. **Does the code conform to team standards?**
3. **Is the code robust?**
4. **Does it really need optimisation?**

We code to make the world more efficient, but some problems just aren't worth worrying about. Consult this xkcd graphic if in doubt:

And remember the now infamous quote from Tony Hoare/Donald Knuth: 

> Premature optimisation is the root of all evil!
