# üèÉ Moving Away from Interpretation

Moving away from interpretation involves exploring alternative approaches to executing Python code, transcending the traditional interpreter-based execution model. 

We saw this with PyPy in the previous section. But in this section, we'll be more explicit.

This involves delving into the integration of C within Python environments and the compilation of Python code using other Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) and Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation methods. These techniques aim to enhance performance, efficiency, and the potential for Python applications by leveraging the strengths of compiled languages and dynamic compilation strategies.
