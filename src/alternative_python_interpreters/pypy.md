# üèéÔ∏è PyPy

PyPy stands out as the most popular alternative Python interpreter, known for its impressive speed improvements over CPython. PyPy achieves its performance through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles Python code into machine code at runtime. This can lead to significant performance gains, especially in long-running applications. However, if you have short but frequently run scripts, the compilation overhead can be a concern. 

**Features:**

- JIT compilation for faster execution.
- Compatibility with Python 2.7 and 3.10 (at time of writing).
- Supports most of the Python standard library and many third-party modules.

**When to Use:**

PyPy is best suited for long-running applications where the overhead of JIT compilation can be amortized over time. It's particularly beneficial for applications with heavy numerical computations or extensive use of loops (but you may not need it if using NumPy!).

**Code Example:**

The usage of PyPy is straightforward because it's a drop-in replacement for CPython. First, download it from [https://www.pypy.org/](https://www.pypy.org/)

You can run your Python script using PyPy just by using the `pypy` command instead of `python`:

```shell
pypy script.py
```
