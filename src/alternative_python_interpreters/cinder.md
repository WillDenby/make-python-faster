# ğŸ”¥ Cinder

Cinder is Meta's (formerly Facebook's) performance-oriented fork of CPython 3.8. It incorporates several enhancements aimed at improving the performance of Python code, notably in highly concurrent server environments. Cinder is not a standalone interpreter but has contributed some of its features back to the main Python branch, showcasing its influence on the Python ecosystem.

**Features:**

- Static Python: An experimental, opt-in type system that allows for compiling Python to more efficient code, improving performance.
- Strict Modules: Provides a way to declare modules with stricter performance characteristics, allowing Cinder to optimize these modules more aggressively.
- Performance Enhancements: Includes various optimizations for faster execution of Python code, particularly in the context of web and server applications.

**When to Use:**

Cinder is tailored for large-scale, performance-sensitive Python applications, especially those running in server environments. It's most beneficial for organizations that can invest in managing a custom Python interpreter to gain execution speed.

**Code Example:**

While Cinder's usage is similar to standard Python, benefiting from its features often requires adopting specific patterns or annotations in your code, such as using static types:

```python
from static import int64

def fib(n: int64) -> int64:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

Cinder is used similarly to CPython, but with an emphasis on its performance-enhancing features.
