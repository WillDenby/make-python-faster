# üòµ‚Äçüí´ Non-Linear Execution

A strictly sequential, or linear, flow of execution in Python (or any programming language) can have several drawbacks in terms of code speed, especially as the complexity and scale of the tasks increase. Here are some of the key issues. 

- **Single-Core Utilization**: Modern computers have multiple cores (or CPUs), which allow them to perform several operations in parallel. Sequential code only occupies one core at a time, leaving other cores idle and underutilized. This means that the program is not taking full advantage of the available hardware resources to speed up execution.
- **I/O Bound Processes**: In a strictly sequential execution, the program waits for I/O operations (like reading from a file or network requests) to complete before proceeding to the next step. This waiting time can significantly slow down the overall execution, as the CPU remains idle during these periods, wasting precious computation time.
- **Inefficient Handling of Large Data Sets**: When dealing with large data sets, sequential processing can be very time-consuming because each item is processed one after the other. Parallel processing techniques, like those provided by libraries such as multiprocessing or concurrent.futures in Python, can distribute the data and computation across multiple cores, significantly reducing processing time.
- **Lack of Scalability**: Sequential code is hard to scale. As the amount of data or the complexity of the problem increases, the execution time increases linearly (or sometimes even more than linearly). In contrast, parallel or concurrent execution models can scale more effectively by distributing work across available resources.

Python's Global Interpreter Lock, which we'll explore in the next chapter, is often behind this. To mitigate it, developers use parallelism, concurrency, or asynchronous programming models. These approaches allow the program to make better use of system resources, handle I/O more efficiently, and improve overall execution speed.
