# ðŸ•’ time.time()

The `time.time()` function from the Python standard library is a straightforward way to measure the elapsed time during code execution. It returns the current time in seconds since the Epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). You can use it to calculate how long a piece of code takes to execute by recording the time before and after the execution and then finding the difference.

## Usage Example:

Hereâ€™s a simple setup for `time.time()`:

```python
import time

start_time = time.time()

# Place the code you want to time here
time.sleep(2)  # Example: simple sleep for 2 seconds

end_time = time.time()
elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"Elapsed time: {elapsed_time} seconds")
```

This method is basic, but useful for quick-and-dirty profiling. You can use it to identify areas for more refined profiling.
